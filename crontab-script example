# Crontab configuration for scheduling service executions

# First, we should set the schedule date/time period for the service
# Then we will select the directory from where the command should be executed
# After that, we define the command/application to run (/bin/bash, /usr/bin/python3, etc.)
# Finally, we can select the options (such as script names, etc.)
# Ex.: 0 0 * * * cd /home/onlibrary && /bin/bash /home/onlibrary/script.sh

# Defining the app root folder (must be updated for different machines/users)
APP_ROOT_FOLDER="/home/onlibrary/systems/api-onlibrary"
# Defining the Python bin path for the app's virtual env (must be updated for different machines/users/envs)
ENV_PYTHON="/home/onlibrary/systems/api-onlibrary/env/bin/python"

# Task scheduler for documents expiration notification
# The PYTHONPATH must be set, or there might be problems on project's folder importing when using venv on Unix machines
# It'll be executed daily at 10:00 (local machine time)
0 10 * * * export PYTHONPATH=$APP_ROOT_FOLDER && cd $APP_ROOT_FOLDER && $ENV_PYTHON $APP_ROOT_FOLDER"/app/jobs/documents_expiration.py"
